‚ú® Features
----------

-   **Custom Gateway Integration:** Registers and manages a complete, native payment method within the WooCommerce checkout flow.

-   **Dynamic UI Control:** Utilizes the specific dynamic hook (`woocommerce_thankyou_{gateway_id}`) to completely control and customize the "Order Received" (Thank You) page content.

-   **Streamlined Confirmation:** Intentionally suppresses default WooCommerce output (like the product table and addresses) to provide a **focused, custom message** that prioritizes the installment payment terms.

-   **Installment Scheduling:** Simulates the secure logging of a future 3-part installment schedule (30 and 60 days) to the database, ready for a separate billing process.

-   **Secure Coding Standards:** Adheres to WordPress security best practices, including mandatory unslashing (`wp_unslash()`) before sanitization of input data.

-   **Auditable Logging:** Logs the initial payment and the installment setup process directly into the standard WooCommerce **Order Notes** for an immediate, auditable trail.
